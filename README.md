A Brief introduction on Cloud
The cloud — often used as shorthand for “cloud computing” — refers to a pool of computer services accessed over the internet. This pool is accessible on-demand and self-service, giving instant access to services without setup. 

Why Business Migrate to the Cloud
Flexibility
Cloud-based services are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your needs increase, it’s easy to scale up your cloud capacity, drawing on the service’s remote servers. Likewise, if you need to scale down again, the flexibility is baked into the service. This level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors.

Low-Cost Disaster Recovery
Businesses of all sizes should invest in robust disaster recovery, but for smaller businesses that lack the required cash and expertise, this is often more of an ideal than the reality. Cloud computing is now helping more organizations buck that trend.

Let the Cloud Update Your Software
The beauty of cloud computing is that the servers are off premises, out of sight and out of your hair. Suppliers take care of them for you and roll out regular software updates—including security updates—so you don’t have to worry about wasting time maintaining the system yourself. This leaves you free to focus on the things that matter, like growing your business.

Capital-Expenditure Free (Opex vs Capex)
Cloud computing cuts out the high cost of hardware. You simply pay as you go and enjoy a subscription-based model that’s kind to your cash flow. Add to that the ease of setup and management, and suddenly your scary, hairy IT project looks a lot friendlier. It’s never been easier to take the first step to cloud adoption.

Increased Collaboration
When your teams can access, edit, and share documents anytime, from anywhere, they’re able to do more together and do it better. Cloud-based workflow and file-sharing apps help them make updates in real time and give them full visibility into their collaborations.
Work from Anywhere
With moving to the cloud, if you’ve got an internet connection, you can be at work. And with most serious cloud services offering mobile apps, you’re not restricted by which device you have on hand.
Security
Lost laptops are a billion-dollar business problem. Potentially greater than the loss of an expensive piece of kit is the loss of the sensitive data inside it. Cloud computing gives you greater security when this happens. Because your data is stored in the cloud, you can access it no matter what happens to your machine. You can even remotely wipe data from lost laptops so it doesn’t get into the wrong hands.
Competitiveness
Wish there was a simple step you could take to become more competitive? Moving to the cloud gives everyone access to enterprise-class technology. It also allows smaller businesses to act faster than big, established competitors. Pay-as-you-go service and cloud business applications mean small outfits can run with the big boys and disrupt the market, all while remaining lean and nimble. David now packs a Goliath-sized punch.
Environmentally Friendly
While the above points spell out the benefits of cloud computing for your business, moving to the cloud isn’t an entirely selfish act. The environment gets a little love, too. When your cloud needs fluctuate, your server capacity scales up and down to fit. You only use the energy you need, and you don’t leave over-sized carbon footprints.
 
Public,Private,Hybrid and Multicloud
Public cloud
The public cloud, services are owned and run by a third-party vendor (called a cloud service provider) over the public internet. These services can be free or available as pay-per-use to anyone who wishes to use or buy them

Examples of public clouds include
Amazon Web services (AWS)
Microsoft Azure
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
IBM Cloud
Oracle Cloud
The advantages of Public cloud include 24/7 uptime, the ability to only pay for what you use (which can result in cost savings), scalability, and simplified infrastructure management — meaning setup is simple and there’s no need to buy and manage on-premises infrastructure. 
Private cloud
The private cloud, cloud resources are used and owned solely by one organization. That makes this approach desirable by governmental and financial industries that seek maximum control or customization. The private cloud may be located in a data center on-site or hosted by a provider in a remote location. 

Examples of Private clouds include
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE),
Dell, IBM,
Oracle,
Also, some familiar names from the public cloud provider space, including AWS, Google, and Microsoft.
Hybrid cloud
The Hybrid cloud combines elements of private and public cloud and allows resources to move between the two. Hybrid cloud works well for organizations that need an element of private cloud (for example, regulation requirements around sensitive data) but still want access to Public cloud and its big benefits
Like private cloud, this model takes some real IT skill and may require the use of on-site hardware, cutting back on some of the cost benefits of public cloud. It also adds another layer of complexity to the equation.
Multicloud
Multicloud is the use of multiple cloud services in a single environment. This can mean, for example, a mix of public and private clouds or using a mix of public cloud providers to reduce reliance on a single provider or to realize the benefits of more than one provider.
Multicloud is the most popular cloud strategy among enterprises.
How’s multicloud different than hybrid cloud? Multicloud refers to using multiple services (like services from AWS and Azure), while hybrid cloud refers to using multiple deployment models (like using public and private cloud).

SaaS,PaaS and IaaA Service Modles
SaaS
Software as a Service, or SaaS, is software provided over the internet. Nothing is installed on a local computer, tablet, or phone; no one is needed to manage things like patches or updates. It just works.
Examples of SaaS include Dropbox, Salesforce, the G Suite apps (like Gmail), and Microsoft 365.
PaaS
PaaS, or Platform as a Service, is a software building ground for developers. Just Owning the applications and data. PaaS provides a blank slate in the cloud that lets the developers create, deploy, and scale applications without having to own things like infrastructure, storage, or operating systems. 
Examples of PaaS include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, OpenShift, and Google App Engine.
IaaS
Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, means moving infrastructure into the cloud.  (Think: renting a server in the cloud.) Your cloud provider owns the hardware and is responsible for managing and maintaining it, so you don’t have to worry about any maintenance.
Examples of IaaS include AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform,


 
Benefits of migrating to the cloud
1. Elasticity and scalability
Scalability in Cloud allows for improve by giving organizations the ability to almost instantaneously add or take away resources on an as-needed basis or to match demand. The process of scaling can be done automatically (called autoscaling), based on, for example, the time of day or the amount of processor resources being used.
Elasticity goes hand in hand with scalability and refers to the ability to quickly expand or decrease computer processing, memory, and storage resources to meet changing demands without any concerning. Elasticity enables scalability.
2. Cost savings and effectiveness
Cloud gives you the ability to only pay for the resources you use. This gives you access to resources that would cost way too much time and money to keep up yourself, which ties back into scalability. 
A traditional IT approach to scaling up is costly. It takes planning; it can take months, requires hardware at a big upfront cost, electricity to keep it all operating and cool, and skilled IT staff capable of getting (and keeping) it all up and running. With cloud, that’s all done nearly instantly by your cloud provider.
But where cloud scalability really leaves on-prem scalability in the dust is around decreasing resources. Traditional IT infrastructure can require having enough resources to handle peak demand. (For example, a retailer having to pay for the data center resources to be ready for a rush of Black Friday shoppers, even though they’re not half as busy the other 364 days of the year.) Cloud infrastructure can scale up and down with the peaks and valleys of a year, month, day, or hour. 
Reduction in costs
You can migrate any workload – applications, websites, databases, storage, physical or virtual servers – and even entire data centers from an on-premises environment, hosting facility, or other public cloud to AWS,GCP, Azure or any other cloud. Every step along the way, you can leverage AWS,GCP, Azure or any other cloud years of experience to build your organizational, operational, and technical capabilities, so that you can gain business benefits faster.

3. Move from CapEx to OpEx
Cloud shifts tech systems from a capital expenditure (CapEx) to an operating expenditure (OpEx) — or from an investment in something you hold onto for a few years that will depreciate in value (like a bunch of expensive hardware) to a regular, ongoing cost for running the business (like paying for internet). That’s great news for businesses that like to hang onto as much cash as possible.
Cloud computing technologies by itself is innovative because it moves from the traditional Capital Expenditure (CapEx) mode with onsite server infrastructure to an Operational Expenditure (OpEx) mode using a third-party cloud service provider with service level agreements.

4. Agility and Flexibility
Agility
Agility can mean a couple of different things around the cloud. “Cloud agility” is often used to describe the ability to quickly develop, test, and launch business applications. But cloud also gives you the agility to respond quickly as needs change. 
The innovative technologies using cloud are based upon recognized industry standards and best practices so that can achieve business objectives.
To meet our clients’ innovative challenges, we can collaborate incorporating the best practices in cloud computing technologies, web applications, mobility, big data, and analytics.which will provide access to a platform, otherwise cost prohibitive to most organizations, reduces risk and maintenance costs of a world-wide software and infrastructure platform. 
Agility ensures that businesses are empowered to priorities issues. Instead of spending valuable time and heaps of money on provisioning and maintaining IT resources, cloud agility shifts emphasis to security, monitoring, and analysis.
Cloud agility refers to the addition of business value. When it comes to the cloud context, agility is all about the ability of an organization to rapidly develop, test, and launch software applications that drive business growth.
Meet the accelerating demand for new containerized apps and cloud capabilities for faster business service delivery.
flexibility
Cloud agility provides flexibility to organizations, allowing them to scale up or down their resources to address website traffic and other demands in order to address sudden or unanticipated production and development needs. The cloud’s pay-per use flexibility makes sure that end-users can rapidly scale as per the organization’s unpredictable needs. Conventional workloads that need on-demand scalability, such as load testing, testing and development, and peak traffic loads, or work done on a new application, can be easily handled
5. Performance, Reliability, and Resiliency 
The big cloud service providers run a worldwide, world-class network of facilities packed with cutting-edge tech. This ensures everything from keeping network latency low to delivering near unparalleled data backup and disaster recovery. No matter where the people who need access to your tools are, the cloud typically brings them closer.
6. Security and Compliance
Most cloud providers are big companies with big companies relying on them. That’s why they go out of the way to consider security and compliance, which includes staying on top of updates and trends that will ensure your sensitive data is safe in the cloud.
Public cloud providers typically bring to the table policies, tech, and controls that are a huge step up from the average organization’s security practices. This is paired with considerations for almost any industry-specific compliance needs.
Plus, keeping data in the cloud rather than on your hard drive can also keep data from getting compromised if a device is stolen or misplaced.
7. Less Maintenance and Simplification of IT
Maintaining computer hardware and software is a full-time job. Literally. With public cloud, you don’t have to have employees spending time dedicated to the tedious maintenance of equipment that doesn’t directly contribute to business objectives. Your cloud service provider ensures the infrastructure is in place, so your tech wizards can focus on driving business outcomes.
The best way to avoid the costs and complexities of refactoring and repatriation is to do a thorough analysis of the applications and workloads before you begin any migration. Why are you considering the cloud? What are the application requirements? What are the business goals? What are the interdependencies between each app and workload? How much will the migration cost and, once it is completed, what will be the ongoing operational costs?
In doing this analysis, you may decide that the application is better served by remaining on premises, or incorporating public cloud services in a hybrid cloud model that involves a lift-and-shift migration. If the analysis determines that refactoring is necessary, it is still important to choose the right migration path so you can avoid repatriation in the future.
In migrating applications to the public cloud, IT teams are confronting two separate but related issues that add costs and complexity: refactoring and repatriation.
Refactoring is the process of rewriting code to make the application more cloud-ready, typically updating the overall application architecture, APIs and integrations with compute, storage and network resources. Refactoring helps legacy apps take on characteristics of cloud-native apps, making it more feasible for developers to use modern tools such as containers and microservices.
Repatriation is the process of pulling back applications that have been migrated to the cloud and returning them to the data center. The most common reasons for repatriation are concerns about operating costs, cloud-based workload performance, security and compliance, availability and changing business needs
By leveraging a cloud platform that tightly integrates on-premises infrastructure with cloud management software, IT teams can use pervasive automation to make the lift-and-shift migration as seamless as possible.
Before deciding on migrating your assets to a cloud, consider the benefits. Will they apply to your business? Look at the list of cloud migrations benefits below to find out, how this process may influence the way you work.
Scalability – it is much easier to grow and to keep (and improve) the quality of your work when using cloud-based solutions. Moreover, it is then your cloud provider business to prepare their infrastructure for your growth. What’s even better is that your cloud can adjust the level of assets needed for the amount of traffic you’re exposed to. In other words, clouds make it possible that scalability happens instantly.
Reliability – together with better scalability, comes the higher reliability. Clouds are designed in such a way, that they (almost) always are accessible and ready to work. As a cloud user, you don’t rely on one server or data-center only. As a result, you can count on incredibly high SLA, sometimes reaching 100% accessibility!
Disaster recovery and automatic backup – help you ensure that nothing vanishes in case of any breakdown. Clouds are almost data-loss resistant because store copies of data in multiple locations.
Security – previous points also add up to the security benefit. However, there’s more to this. Cloud providers usually have access to better, more breach-resistant security solutions as well as experts. What’s more, as their customer, you’re not alone regarding security and software updates. Cloud providers usually offer the so-called Shared Responsibility Model, in which the responsibility for maintenance and security is divided between the customer and provider.
Lower costs – especially if you choose e.g. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) you will gain the ability to adjust the infrastructure and costs to your current situation and needs.
Improved monitoring and analytics – cloud solutions often have built-in monitoring services. Together with automatic and standardized logging of the key metrics, you are equipped with access to the most reliable data bout your infrastructure and maintenance. Even better, most cloud providers offer e-mail or phone notifications about the state of your infrastructure, assets, or breakdown.
Improved IT resource management – when you want to change anything in your IT hardware, you need to find, buy, and assemble new parts (you, or your IT expert). When you are a cloud customer, all you need to do is to choose proper components in Software as a Service or Infrastructure as a Service models. It smoothens your processes.
Increased mobility – with a cloud, it’s much easier (and more secure) to work remotely and in a move. It’s become even more vital after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased mobility also means that moving your office is easier and makes your company more flexible.
Collaboration – clouds make it easier to collaborate as well. Especially for remote teams with workers in different locations.
Reduced carbon footprint – last but not least, thanks to the economies of scale, cloud providers are often greener and produce lower carbon footprint.
Summing up, cloud migration will help you enhance your business performance, improves your company scalability, ensuring security at the same time. Moreover, it is a way to transform your company and make it more Agile.
